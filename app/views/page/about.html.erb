	<p>
		The mission of EOL's Global Biotic Interactions (GLoBI) is to find efficient ways to normalize and integrate species-interaction data. By making this data readily available, GloBI will enable researchers and enthusiasts to answer questions about localized, one-to-one species interactions and big-picture changes in species interactions over time. For example, GloBI can answer which species an Angel Shark (Squatina squatina) eats in the Gulf of Mexico, or return the results of a query for the number of Angel Sharks feeding in the Gulf of Mexico between 2005 and 2010.
